# Hi there, I'm Noah ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a ~~grade 12 high school student~~ aspiring developer in Toronto, Canada. I like helping people, solving problems, and doing cool things. 

I mostly work in python, but I also know Javascipt (for web development), java (for school), and C (when I want to confuse myself). Currently, I'm looking into AI stuff, it seems trendy.
